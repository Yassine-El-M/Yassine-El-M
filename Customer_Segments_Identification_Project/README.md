### Project Overview:

The project aims to segment customers of a mail-order company based on demographic information, allowing for targeted marketing and advertising efforts. The use of unsupervised learning techniques allows for the discovery of unseen patterns and relationships within the data, providing valuable insights for the company. To complete this project, it is recommended to use the Anaconda distribution, which is a pre-packaged Python distribution that contains all of the necessary libraries and software. Alternatively, you can make use of Google Colaboratory, which allows you to write and execute Python codes in your browser. The data for this project is provided by AZ Direct and Arvato Financial Services and includes demographic information for the general population of Germany and customers of a mail-order company, with a total of 891211 and 191652 individuals respectively, and 85 features for each. Additionally, a summary of the feature attributes for the demographic data is also provided. However, the data is removed prior to the agreement, as it is only for use in the Udacity Bertelsmann unsupervised learning project.
