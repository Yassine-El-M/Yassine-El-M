# Udacity - Bertelsmann Scholarship : Introduction to Machine Learning with TensorFlow
This repo contains the 3 projects for the Udacity Intro to Machine Learning with TensorFlow course.

Supervised Learning - Finding Donors for CharityML
Deep Learning - Image Classification with Tensorflow
Unsupervised Learning - Identify Customer Segments with Arvato

## -supervised learning:
I started by learning how to use Sklearn to train and evaluate models. I reviewed the primary measures for assessing models, including recall, accuracy, and precision. Then, I discovered some typical supervised learning techniques, such as support vector machines, decision trees, naive Bayes, neural networks, and linear and logistic regression. In the section covering ensemble methods, I learnt how to combine different algorithms to maximize their potential. Every section had a lab, where I was able to use Sklearn to put my knowledge to use.

## -Deep Learning:
This section taught me the basic math and theory of neural networks, which can be trained to recognize patterns in supplied data. I used NumPy to construct backpropagation and optimization to gain a basic grasp of neural networks before progressing to training neural networks with TensorFlow, a deep learning framework. I can now create my own image classifier using TensorFlow.

## -Unsupervised Learning:
In this section, I delved into the primary unsupervised learning algorithms, including various clustering techniques and dimensionality reduction methods. The emphasis of unsupervised learning is on finding patterns or groupings within data without a predefined goal, such as accuracy. It is also commonly utilized to decrease the number of features in a dataset while maintaining crucial information. Through several mini-projects and labs, I had the opportunity to apply these concepts using real data and gain a better understanding of unsupervised learning.
